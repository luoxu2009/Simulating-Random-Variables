# Simulating-Random-Variables
Simulating Random Variables that follows various distributions with different methods

In this notebook, I will explore generating random variables with various distributions from Random Uniform (0,1) distributions
1. Generate Random Variable (RV) that follows exponential distribution with Inverse Transform Method
2. Generate RV that follows Beta(4,3) distribution with Acceptance-Rejection Method
3. Generate RV that follows Normal distribution with the Box-Muller Transform method
4. Generate RV that follows Poisson Distribution starting from exponential distributed RV
